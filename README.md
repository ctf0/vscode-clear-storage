# Clear Storage

currently in-order to clear the user global/workspace storage, you have to do it manually, but now we can automate that.

### Notes

- we only remove the direct directories/folders of the user global/workspace storage paths.
- when clearing the workspace storage, any opened tabs will be closed & opened file history will also be gone so be ware.
